Going forward, blade files should be titled with one word, describing its function, and placed inside sub-directories relating to specific parts of the system.

### For Example

A partial table row showing the accommodation inventory would be:
> views/partials/accommodation/inventory/row.blade.php

A view to test the output of order api routes:
> views/tests/orders/api.blade.php

A template view for the PDF of an invoice:
> views/pdf/invoice.blade.php
